# Ask the user for two integer values,
# then use those two values to calculate and show the following:

# The sum of the two numbers.
# The difference of the two numbers.
# The product of the two numbers.
# The integer based division of the two numbers (so no decimal point). First divided by second.
# The remainder of integer division of the two numbers.

v1 = int(input('What is the first value: '))
v2 = int(input('What is the second value: '))

# sum
print(v1+v2)
# difference
print(v1-v2)
# product
print(v1*v2)
# integer based division
print(v1//v2)
# remainder
print(v1%v2)
